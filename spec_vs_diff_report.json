  "summary": "The diff modifies Partners.tsx to display a partner photo using the path '/assets/generated/umb-photo.dim_400x400.jpg', which matches the image-edit crop requirement. However, the actual image file (frontend/public/assets/generated/umb-photo.jpg or the dim_400x400 variant) is not present in the diff as an added file, meaning the static asset itself was never committed.",

      "requirement": "Store the image as a static asset at frontend/public/assets/generated/umb-photo.jpg",
      "reason": "No image file was added in the diff. The ADDED FILES section shows 'none', so the physical asset at frontend/public/assets/generated/umb-photo.jpg (or umb-photo.dim_400x400.jpg) is absent. The component references the path but the file itself is never stored.",
