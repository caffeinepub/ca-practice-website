  "summary": "Both REQ-1 and REQ-2 appear to be implemented in the diff. The static partners array in Partners.tsx contains exactly 5 entries, and a slice(0, 5) cap is applied to displayedPartners. The file summary confirms the component ensures the UI always shows exactly 5 partner cards regardless of backend data, suggesting REQ-2 is also addressed, though the truncation prevents full verification of the backend data capping logic.",
