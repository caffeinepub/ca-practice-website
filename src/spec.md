# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a Government Resources section with quick access links to official government and regulatory websites.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a Government Resources section component displaying a grid of links to official websites (Income Tax Department, ROC, MCA, SEBI, GST Portal, Professional Tax, MahaGST, RERA, NSE, BSE)
- Each link shows an icon, website name, and description
- All links open in new tabs
- Position the section after Notifications and before Tax Calculators
- Style consistently with the existing emerald green and warm amber color scheme
- Ensure responsive design for mobile devices

**User-visible outcome:** Users can quickly access important government and regulatory websites through a dedicated section with organized, clickable links that open in new tabs.
