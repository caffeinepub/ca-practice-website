# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add the uploaded partner photo (UMB PHOTO.jpg) as a profile picture for a partner entry in the Partners section.

**Planned changes:**
- Save the uploaded photo as a static asset at `frontend/public/assets/generated/umb-photo.jpg`
- Update the Partners component to use this image as the profile picture for the corresponding partner entry

**User-visible outcome:** The Partners section displays the uploaded photo as a partner's profile picture, rendering correctly on both desktop and mobile layouts.
