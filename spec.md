# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove the Government Notifications & Circulars section from the website.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove the `<Notifications />` component from `App.tsx`
- Remove the navigation link for the Notifications/Circulars section from `Navigation.tsx`
- Ensure the page layout remains visually coherent after removal

**User-visible outcome:** The website no longer displays the Government Notifications & Circulars section, and the navigation bar no longer contains a link to it. All other sections remain intact.
